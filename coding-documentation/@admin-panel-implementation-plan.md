# Admin Panel Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the admin panel in our Next.js application. The admin panel will provide administrators with tools to manage various aspects of the application, including document processing, connectors, and other configuration settings.

## Components

### 1. Document Processing Configuration
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Interface for configuring document processing settings, including integration with the Unstructured API for enhanced document parsing.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created admin page at `/admin/configuration/document-processing`
  - Added UI for managing Unstructured API key
  - Implemented API routes for saving, retrieving, validating, and deleting the API key
  - Integrated with Supabase for secure storage of API keys
  - Added validation to ensure API keys are valid before saving
  - Implemented fallback processing when Unstructured API is unavailable

### 2. Database Schema
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Database tables and schemas required for the admin panel functionality.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created `settings` table in Supabase for storing application configuration
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data security
  - Added indexes for efficient querying
  - Set up triggers for automatic timestamp updates

### 3. Document Processing Service
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Service for processing documents using the Unstructured API.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Implemented `processWithUnstructured` function for handling various document types
  - Added support for PDF, DOCX, and other file formats
  - Created helper functions to check if file types are supported
  - Implemented error handling and fallback to standard processing methods

### 4. API Routes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Description**: Backend API routes for the admin panel functionality.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created route for checking if Unstructured API key is set (`/api/search-settings/unstructured-api-key-set`)
  - Implemented route for saving/updating API key (`/api/search-settings/upsert-unstructured-api-key`)
  - Added route for deleting API key (`/api/search-settings/delete-unstructured-api-key`)
  - Created route for validating API key (`/api/search-settings/check-unstructured-api-key`)
  - Updated document processing routes to use Unstructured API when available

### 5. Connector Management
- **Status**: üîÑ In Progress
- **Description**: Interface for managing data connectors (Google Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.).
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created initial UI for adding connectors at `/admin/add-connector`
  - Implemented connector metadata service
  - Added support for categorizing connectors by type
  - Created UI components for displaying connector icons and information
  - Pending: Implementation of connector-specific configuration pages

### 6. User Management
- **Status**: üìù Planned
- **Description**: Interface for managing users and permissions.
- **Implementation Details**: TBD

### 7. System Settings
- **Status**: üìù Planned
- **Description**: Interface for configuring system-wide settings.
- **Implementation Details**: TBD

## Technical Implementation

### Database Migrations
- Created migration file `20240601000000_add_settings_table.sql` for the settings table
- Implemented RLS policies for secure access to settings data

### API Integration
- Integrated with Unstructured API for enhanced document processing
- Implemented validation and error handling for API interactions
- Added fallback mechanisms for when the API is unavailable

### UI Components
- Used shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Implemented loading states and error handling in the UI
- Added validation feedback for user inputs

## Next Steps

1. Complete the connector management implementation
2. Implement user management features
3. Add system-wide settings configuration
4. Enhance error handling and logging
5. Add usage statistics and monitoring

## Dependencies
- Next.js for the frontend framework
- Supabase for database and authentication
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Unstructured API for document processing
