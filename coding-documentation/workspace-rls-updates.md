# Workspace Sharing RLS Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies to enable proper workspace sharing functionality. This allows users with whom a workspace has been shared to access assistants and related resources within that workspace.

## Current State
Before our implementation, users could see shared workspaces but couldn't access the resources within them (assistants, tools, etc.). We've now added policies to grant appropriate access.

## Policies Implemented

### Existing Policies (Before Implementation)
We identified the following policies already existed in the database:
- `Allow selecting shared workspaces` on `workspace_users`
- `Allow shared workspace users to view assistants` on `assistants`
- `Allow shared workspace users to view assistant_workspaces` on `assistant_workspaces`
- `Allow access to shared workspace members` on `workspaces`

### New Policies Added

#### Workspace Update Policy
- `Allow editors to update workspace` - Allows users with 'editor' or 'admin' roles to update workspaces

#### Assistant Related Resources Policies
- `Allow shared workspace users to view assistant files` - Access to files attached to assistants
- `Allow shared workspace users to view assistant collections` - Access to collections attached to assistants
- `Allow shared workspace users to view assistant tools` - Access to tools attached to assistants
- `Allow shared workspace users to create chats with assistants` - Ability to create chats with assistants

#### Chat Access Policies
- `Allow shared workspace users to create chats` - Ability to create chats in a shared workspace
- `Allow shared workspace users to view chats` - Access to view chats in a shared workspace 
- `Allow shared workspace users to create messages` - Ability to create messages in chats
- `Allow shared workspace users to view messages` - Access to view messages in chats
- `Allow shared workspace users to create messages with assistants` - Enhanced policy for message creation with assistants
- `Allow shared workspace users to update their own messages` - Policy to update messages in shared workspaces
- `Allow shared workspace users to view chats with assistants` - Enhanced policy for chat viewing with assistants

#### Extended Resource Access Policies
- `Allow shared workspace users to view tools` - Access to tools in shared workspaces
- `Allow shared workspace users to view tool_workspaces` - Access to tool workspace associations
- `Allow shared workspace users to view collections` - Access to collections in shared workspaces
- `Allow shared workspace users to view collection_workspaces` - Access to collection workspace associations
- `Allow shared workspace users to view collection_files` - Access to files in collections
- `Allow shared workspace users to view files` - Access to files in shared workspaces
- `Allow shared workspace users to view file_workspaces` - Access to file workspace associations
- `Allow shared workspace users to view file_items` - Access to file items (content chunks)
- `Allow shared workspace users to view presets` - Access to presets in shared workspaces
- `Allow shared workspace users to view preset_workspaces` - Access to preset workspace associations
- `Allow shared workspace users to view prompts` - Access to prompts in shared workspaces
- `Allow shared workspace users to view prompt_workspaces` - Access to prompt workspace associations
- `Allow shared workspace users to view folders` - Access to folders in shared workspaces

#### Tool Specific Policies
- `Allow shared workspace users to use tools` - Enhanced policy for tool usage in shared workspaces
- `Allow editors to update tools in shared workspaces` - Allows editors and admins to modify tools
- `Allow editors to create tool_workspaces in shared workspaces` - Allows editors and admins to associate tools with workspaces
- `Allow editors to update tool_workspaces in shared workspaces` - Allows editors and admins to update tool associations
- `Allow editors to delete tool_workspaces in shared workspaces` - Allows editors and admins to remove tool associations

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Policy Audit (Completed)
- Identified existing policies in the database
- Found 4 policies already implemented for workspace sharing

### Step 2: Workspace Update Policy (Completed)
- Successfully added the policy to allow editors and admins to update workspaces
- Policy allows users with 'editor' or 'admin' roles to modify workspaces they have access to
- Implementation verified with no errors

### Step 3: Assistant Related Resources Policies (Completed)
- Successfully added policies for assistant_files, assistant_collections, and assistant_tools
- These policies allow users to access files, collections, and tools associated with assistants in shared workspaces
- Implementation verified with no errors

### Step 4: Chat Access Policies (Completed)
- Successfully added policies for chat creation and viewing
- Successfully added policies for message creation and viewing
- These policies allow users to create and use chats with assistants in shared workspaces
- Implementation verified with no errors

### Step 5: Extended Resource Access Policies (Completed)
- Successfully added policies for tools, collections, files, presets, prompts, and related resources
- These policies allow users to access all resources associated with shared workspaces
- Implementation verified with no errors

### Step 6: Message Creation Fix (Completed)
- Successfully addressed issue with message creation in shared workspaces
- Added enhanced policies for message creation and updating in shared workspaces
- Implementation verified and confirmed working

### Step 7: Tool Specific Policies (Completed)
- Successfully added policies for more granular tool management
- Implemented role-based access for tool editing and associations
- Implementation ready for verification

## Next Steps

1. Test the tool-specific policies:
   - Follow the test-tool-sharing.md guide to verify that tool sharing works correctly
   - Test with different user roles (viewer, editor, admin) to ensure proper permission enforcement
   - Verify that tools can be used in chats with assistants in shared workspaces

2. Implement any additional edge case policies based on test results:
   - Address any permission issues discovered during testing
   - Consider adding policies for specific actions that might be missing

3. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Document all RLS policies in a central location
   - Create user guides explaining how permissions work for different user roles
   - Document troubleshooting steps for common permission issues

4. Monitor for any performance issues:
   - Check if the RLS policies cause any performance degradation
   - Optimize queries if needed to ensure good performance with complex policies

## Implementation Date
May 2, 2024 (Initial policies)
May 10, 2024 (Extended resource policies)
May 15, 2024 (Message creation fix)
May 17, 2024 (Tool-specific policies)
