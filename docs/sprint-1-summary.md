- Model, assistant, and preset selection functioning
- Database schema includes all necessary tables
- Basic API routes in place
- Streaming responses working correctly

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Type Safety:**
   - Several components need more specific type definitions
   - Some any types need to be replaced

2. **Error Handling:**
   - API routes need more robust error handling
   - UI error states need improvement

3. **UI/UX:**
   - Loading states missing for data fetching
   - Error handling for failed fetches needed
   - Tooltips needed for model/assistant/preset info
   - Confirmation needed for preset/assistant selection

4. **API Routes:**
   - CORS headers needed
   - Request validation needed
   - Rate limiting consideration for future

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Long names in dropdowns need testing
   - Large lists performance needs verification

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Add loading states to AssistantSelect and PresetSelect
2. Implement error handling for data fetching
3. Add tooltips for assistant/preset capabilities
4. Add confirmation dialogs for selections

### Sprint 2 Preparation
1. Plan CORS implementation
2. Design request validation strategy
3. Plan CRUD operations for assistants/presets
4. Consider rate limiting implementation

## Conclusion
Sprint 1 successfully verified the core functionality of the Chatbot UI. While some improvements are needed, the fundamental building blocks are in place and working. The identified issues are well-documented and can be addressed in upcoming sprints.
